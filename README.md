Medkits
3 types are available, medicine bags crafted at basic crafting spots using herbal medicine, standard medkits crafted at tailoring benches using normal medicine, and a glitterworld version of the standard medkit. To use the medkit equip it as an accessory using forced equip or by making an outfit. All 3 kits have the same 3 abilities, bandage will bandage all of the wearers wounds on the spot, bandage in bed will do the same but they will find the nearest medical bed first, and bandage others will allow you to select another pawn to be tended to, even during combat.

Repair kits
The repair kit is constructed at a tailoring bench, it gives +12% bonus to construction speed and construction and repair success chance. And a passive ability which allows the wearer to salvage broken components while repairing broken down buildings, the chance is based on construction skill. The broken component can then be repaired at a machining table using 10 steel.
